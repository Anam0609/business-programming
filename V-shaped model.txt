List 5 advantages and 5 disadvantages of V-model methodologies.

Advantages

1. Each phase has specific deliveries
2. Higher chances of success over the waterfall model due to the development test plans early on during the life cycle
3. Time concern in comparison with the waterfall mode is low or even we can say 50% less
4. Works well for small projects where requirements are easily understood
5. Utility of the resources is high.

Disadvantages

1. Very rigid, like the waterfall model.
2. Little flexibility and adjusting scope is difficult and expensive
3. Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced.
4. V model doesn't provide a clear path for problems found during testing phases.  
5. if any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.
